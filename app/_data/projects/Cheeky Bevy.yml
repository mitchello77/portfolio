  Cheeky Bevy was a business I developed as part of a university subject. A real market place was simulated and the entire process to developing a small business was covered. The result was two market days where our business sold out products. Cheeky Bevy offered a range of sweet-flavoured beverages and was themed to current trends that resonate with the target audience.
