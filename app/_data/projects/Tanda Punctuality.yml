  Welcome to my solution to the coding challenge 'Punctuality' presented by TandaHQ.
  I decided to complete the challenge ‘Punctuality’ which is an per-employee summary of shift punctuality. I chose this challenge because it appealed to me and my technical prowess. I was also intesrested in 'Browser Rosters' and 'Pings' but I felt this was a nice mixture between front-end and back-end design/engineering and therefore would showcase my abilities.
